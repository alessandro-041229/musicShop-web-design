next one must press on the button 'admin' on the apache section for access and visualize the web sites contained 
in the 'local host' folder inside wich you must insert the file downloaded from here and unzip it
the folder can be found in the xampp folder inside the local disk section

# Additional notes

all infos for the various logins can be found in the database where the accounts are listed
for access the database is necessary to open the application installed of hidelSQL after XAMPP is started up
once done that you can simply open the application and select the database to run and control

# how to use

it's based on a simple login interface, you can register new users when you want as a client
but administrators who can add and edit songs can be added only in the database directly
but for now the credential for the first administrator are 'TEE03' as username and 'abcd.1234' as password

once runned upon loading credits you'll be able to buy musical discs or songs whitout trouble
and as administrator you'll be able to add new products or singers
